<h1>Sunny Land</h1>
<p>Sunny Land was a game that was made as my final project for my Game Programming 1 class. This project was a solo project so I did everything but had to follow a "strict" guideline on how everything had to look, the animations, sounds and everything. This was my first game that I made from scratch with given asset packs.</p>

<h1>King Renegade</h1>
<p>King Renegade is my final project for my Game Programming 2 class and this game is still a work in progress. This is a demo of the level that I created, which is a tutorial level where you learn how to play the game. This project is being done in a team of 3. For this project I worked on the main character, Level 1 design, lighting, special effects, player animations and tip popups. This project is the first project that I have worked on a team so it's given me some experience on working in a team environment. We used for version control and trello project management. We also built our game by following a GDD (Game Design Document) that we made as a team.</p>

<h1>All White Night</h1>
<p>All White Night was a game that me and 6 other people came up with in 46 hours during a game jam. The theme for the game had to "all nighter". So our idea for the game was that you were at a party in a haunted manor and throughout the night you noticed that people falling asleep were getting taken away. So the goal is to survive the night and not run out of energy and fal asleep. There are coffees and energy drinks placed throughout the manor for you to drink and gain energy, but a fair warning to stay out of the darkness or else your energy depleats faster. Stay awake and find a way out of the manor.
