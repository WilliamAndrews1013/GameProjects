<h1>Sunny Land</h1>
<p>Sunny Land was a game that was made as my final project for my Game Programming 1 class. This project was a solo project so I did everything but had to follow a "strict" guideline on how everything had to look, the animations, sounds and everything. This was my first game that I made from scratch with given asset packs.</p>

<h1>King Renegade (GameProgFinal)</h1>
<p>King Renegade is my final project for my Game Programming 2 class and this game is still a work in progress. This is a demo of the level that I created, which is a tutorial level where you learn how to play the game. This project is being done in a team of 3. For this project I worked on the main character, Level 1 design, lighting, special effects, player animations and tip popups. This project is the first project that I have worked on a team so it's given me some experience on working in a team environment. We used for version control and trello project management.
